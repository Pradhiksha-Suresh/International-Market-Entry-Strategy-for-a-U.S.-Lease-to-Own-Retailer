This project is an international business case study analyzing whether a U.S.-based lease-to-own company, Coe’s, should expand operations into the Mexican market. The study evaluates strategic, economic, cultural, legal, and operational factors influencing international expansion, using structured business frameworks such as PESTEL analysis, market and competitor analysis, and risk assessment. Drawing on real-world examples of successful U.S. firms operating in Mexico, the project assesses consumer demand, competitive dynamics, regulatory requirements, logistical challenges, and currency risks. Based on these insights, a phased market entry strategy is proposed, beginning with a pilot launch in Mexico City supported by local partnerships, culturally adapted payment models, targeted marketing, and performance monitoring through KPIs. The project concludes with a strategic recommendation to pursue international expansion while balancing risk through gradual scaling and contingency planning, demonstrating applied knowledge of global business strategy and decision-making.
